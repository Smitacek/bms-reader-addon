# Changelog

## [1.1.9] - 2025-09-28
### Added
- One-off discovery mode that scans serial ports and Modbus addresses, writes ready-to-copy YAML to `/data/discovered_batteries.yaml`
- Documentation and options for `discovery_mode` and related settings
- Energy Dashboard compatibility: cumulative `energy_in_total` and `energy_out_total` sensors (kWh) with `device_class: energy` and `state_class: total_increasing`

### Changed
- Discovery now includes new energy sensors; device `sw_version` set to 1.1.9

## [1.1.8] - 2025-09-28
### Added
- Energy Dashboard compatibility: cumulative `energy_in_total` and `energy_out_total` sensors (kWh) with `device_class: energy` and `state_class: total_increasing` for each battery and the virtual battery
- Persistent energy counters stored under `/data/bms_energy_counters.json`

### Changed
- Discovery now includes the new energy sensors; device `sw_version` set to 1.1.8

## [1.1.7] - 2025-09-28
### Added
- Support for stable /dev/serial/by-id paths for USB serial devices
